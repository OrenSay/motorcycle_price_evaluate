# motorcycle_price_evaluate
Side project I did made between semesters to improve my python, data analysis an ML skills. 
I made a model to evaluate used motorcycles price in Israel using yad2.co.il sales ads.
First I used Selenium to scarp the data from the seales ads posted on yad2.co.il and stored it in Pandas dataframe. Then cleaned uncomputable and incomplete data and used Matplotlib to assess it.
finally implamented a model with Scikit-learn.
